# React Portfolio
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to build a single page portfolio using React.js. I used Bootstrap for page styling, and deployed using GitHub pages.

## Visuals 
![Site]

## Future Implementations 
This project still needs minor tweaks -- changes are being made to the styling of the portfolio cards.
